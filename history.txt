CHANGELOG:
----------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.x:

Made s3ls output more useful for machine processing
Removed &quot;'s from eTag
Command_s3get() opens output files in binary format to avoid corruption. (need to check file usage elsewhere)

Version 0.2:
Features:
Made s3ls list buckets by default, only doing deep listing with -r option.
Added bucket aliases, local names for buckets. For example, you can define a "files" alias for a "files.domain.com" bucket.
Added more flexible object paths: "bucket object",  "bucket:object", "bucket/object"

Other:
Cleaned up some of the code.
Added some upper case file extensions to detected list. *.JPG files are recognized now.
Fixed license.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.1:
Fixed incorrect usage help call that kept s3tool from compiling.
Added version number
Added genidx command
